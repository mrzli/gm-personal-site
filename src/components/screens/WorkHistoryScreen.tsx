In addition to technical work, I was also involved with onboarding and mentoring new employees, and interviewing potential candidates. Our work was on a system that is fully in production, and company depends on it working. We implemented the practice of continuous integration. In addition to adding new features and solving technical issues, I had ownership of disparate parts of the system, I was involved (and sometimes was the primary evangelist) in initiatives related to code quality improvements, such as changes to the way we do unit testing and introduction of monorepo. On occasion I was required to do code changes that would effect the functioning of the entire system, and (in cooperation with other developers and PMs) was able to do that without significant issues. I was also required to do occasional migrations on a production Mongo database, and with careful testing and work process was able to do that without any errors during my time at the company. Most of my technical work was on the backend node application (all the way from the API down to the database), and a smaller part of my job was working on an admin web app written in Angular.',

My job was refactoring large chunks of the frontend code base, from the API interface to the UI. This included: refactoring of components and entire app sections, fixing application-wide typing issue, complete refactoring of the state management system and async (API calling) infrastructure (using Redux and redux-observable), cleaning-up top level app structure, clean-up and changes to the development/build toolchain (scripts, Webpack), introduction of linting, some tests (all 'utility' code was well covered by tests, but I did only basic testing for component and a handful of Cypress tests - login process etc). I included Storybook and used it to create a component library (sort of like a wrapper around Material-UI) that matched existing app styles to reduce the existing code duplication. And of course, I did new feature development and fixes when necessary.",

A colleague and I did not get on board of this project from the start, but we did get on it from the start of any sizeable development efforts (there was some very sporadic development before, by a single person I believe, and the project was in some kind of a prototype phase). The two of us did most of the work in the beginning, and we were able to make some architectural choices at this time, but the team quickly grew over the next few months to (I think) more than 10 people on the frontend alone. After this, my role was essentially that of a senior developer. I was responsible for some application-wide changes, some subsystems/patterns that were reused throughout the project, and also some larger features and screens, down to simpler maintenance work when required.',

For backend, I used Spring Boot/Kotlin, Liquibase for database setup and migrations and PostgreSQL for database (H2 for development and automated tests). As an experiment, and since it is more flexible and more familiar to me, I implemented detailed tests for the backend using Jest/TypeScript, along with the scripts to set everything up (build project and run server if necessary). Obviously, this is not super fast, but it tests the entire backend stack and covers a large part of the functionality - works great for my case. There are no automated tests for the frontend. I also used Docker and Docker Swarm on the project, but only in development to automate certain tasks and try out a more automated deployment process, but in the end the production deployment was still being done manually.',

The validation rules needed to be configurable, and for this I used a json file several thousand lines long, to account for all of the needed checks. The component is used as a part of larger system(s). Conceptually, the component works simply by accepting a structured list of invoice data, and outputs a structured list of validation errors and warnings (if any) with all the relevant data for each issue:',

Since the inputs and outputs were so clearly defined, and the validation logic quite complicated, this is probably the best example of an application where automated tests are so easily devised and so invaluable. The first batch of detailed manual tests done by QA revealed a few errors (in a very large number of test scenarios). I was given a very well structured Excel file with results, which I was easily able to convert to a CSV usable for testing. So all of those tested scenarios (the ones that already passed, and the ones that failed) became part of the testing suite. All I needed to do was make the changes so that all of the tests pass, which was very easy at this point. There were no further errors that I know of.',
